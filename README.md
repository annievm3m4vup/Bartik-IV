# Bartik-IV

## Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020): 

1. Bartik IV: formed by interacting local industry shares and national industry growth rates. 

1.1 Share: the differential exposure to common shocks

1.2 Exogeneity: the shares

1.3 Examples of outcomes: (1) wage growth (2) change in manufacturing employment (3) changes in the residual log wage gap between immigrants and natives. 

2. How to test the credibility?

2.1 Test the correlates of the shares

2.2 Test the parallel pretrends: Standard difference-in-differences design with pre-period

3. Immigrant enclave example (Card, 2009): 

3.1 the share do not sum top 1 within a localtion

3.2 Main specification: Y_lj = b0 + b1 * ln X_lj + b2 * X_l + e_lj

Y_lj: the residual log wage gap between immigrant and native men in skill group j in location l

X_lj: the ratio of immigrant to native hours in skill group j

3.3 First stage: ln X_lj = r0 + r1 * B_lj + r2 * X_l + n_l

B_lj: z_lk,1980 * g_kj

z_lk,1980 = (N_lk,1980/N_k,1980) * (1/P_l,2000)

N_lk,1980: the number of immigrants from country k in localtion l in 1980

N_k,1980: the number of immigrants from country k

P_l,2000: the population of location l in 2000

g_kj: the number of people arriveing in US from 1990 to 2000 from country k and skill group j

3.4 Immigrant enclave: not skill-specific

Immigrant inflows: skill-specific
